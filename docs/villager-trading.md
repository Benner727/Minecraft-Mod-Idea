# Villager Trading

## Goal

Villager trades should be focused on three things:

- Make villager trades focused on exchanging resources
- Have trades for converting resources for a small exchange rate
- Sell mid-tier weapons, tools, and armor

The Wandering trade should be the anti-explorationg trader

- Provides you with resources found in random biomes
- Has a few difficult to obtain items for a steep cost

Possible idea would be for villagers to have their own currency...

- Players would need to trade villagers a variety of resources to gain this currency
- It would be unobtainable from any other source
- Balancing villager trades would be a lot easier
