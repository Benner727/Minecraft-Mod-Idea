# Minecraft Mod Idea

## Overview

The main goal of this mod is to keep the overall theme of the vanilla experience the same.
Minecraft is a game about building and automating. The aim of this mod is to alter how a few
systems work without hindering normal gameplay. 
New systems will be added as a way of providing additional but mostly optional content.
I want to avoid adding needless complexity or arbitrarily gating the player.
Any new mechanics added should be simple, inuitive, and rewarding.
In an ideal scenario this mod would add a better path from the early game to the end game.
I feel like at the moment the early game lasts about ~15-30 minutes, the mid game takes a few hours,
and the majority of Minecraft is just the "end game".
A lot of Minecraft gameplay is pretty aimless and is just done for the sake of doing it.
That is one problem I would like to try and tackle.

## Ideas

<u>[Skills](skills.md) for players to level up</u>

- Number go up
- Creates a better curve for scaling the game without completely gating content

<u>New way of trading [villagers](villager-trading.md)</u>

- Overhaul of villager trading
- Make farming a larger variety of items viable

<u>Late game item sink</u>

- Trying to draw inspiration from vault hunters
- Goal is to give players a reason to farm large quantities of items
