- Nerf food overall

- Eat animation speed based on nutritional value of food (faster the lower the saturation) 

- Crop tiers (Borderline edible - perfect)
Could end up cluttering inventory
Allow bundling?
Tiers: Fine, Great, Perfect, Golden.
Fine = worse than vanilla

- Soil Types
3 soil types: Wet, Temperate, Dry. 
Similar crops have similar soil types. 
All crops can grow in any soil, with better results the closer to optimal conditions.

- Plant grow more like melons and pumpkins. Longer time to mature the first time but don't reset to 0 when harvested. Still only in one block though. 

- Market mechanic
Jigsaw market world feature - fixed.
All markets are part of a system with information delays the further apart they are. (Determine prices when player interacts to prevent constant checking?)
Local prices dependent on overall system, weighted toward local.
Seasonal prices.
Rotating inventory (sells soil types, bone meal, tools, good food)
NOT player dependent. 

- Chance of Crop Failures
Individual, cluster, entire connected fields.
Plights and droughts as hurdles to be overcome through progress

 - Growth Conditions / Seasons
All crops still grow in all places.
Crops grow faster the more correct the conditions are.
Nerf base growth time.
Results boosted by better conditions. 
Light level (proxy for daytime)

- Personal level
Determines results and growth multipliers at time of planting or harvest. 
Level up from successful harvests. 
Perks at certain levels further boosting productivity. 
Perks - Yield boost, reputation with traders, growth time boost, crop tier boost
Hoe durability goes down more per harvest at first and lowers with levels. 

- Specific tools
Better results with the right tool.
Lower results with wrong tool and a very low chance of no yield
Better material boosts results too
Use shovel, shears and hoe.

- Genetics / Mutations (booleans)
Seasonal resistance
Stronger maturity reset, i.e start at 75% instead of 50% when harvested. 
Disease / plight resistance
Golden variant
Soil preference resistance

- Add new growable food to the game
Pickable berry bushes (3 tops)
Rework gourds or just add zucchini
